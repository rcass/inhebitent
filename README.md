# INHABITENT

##### Inhabitent was a wordpress theme based site we created using php, sass and a bit of Javascript. In this project we got to touch over the language of php and the syntax required to operate this language. Creating the wordpress theme required us to use php. Since wordpress uses a template hierarchy we must use specific template php files to represent the page we want. We are able to organize and sort our file structure since php allows us to make our code modular. Php lets us get files, meaning we can grab specific parts we created and plug them into each other. Yay to DRY.
